      <h3> <b>1) What is html for? </b></h3>

      HTML is used for web development. Almost all web pages uses HTML as its markup language.

      HTML means <em> HyperText Markup Language.</em>

<p> HTML is the most popular language used in web development.
    And the good news is that HTML is relatively easy to learn.

        <p>You can think in it as a simple Word document in which instead of clicking on <b>bold</b> or <em>italic</em> buttons. You have to write that as commands inside your text. Take a look below:</p>


        <p> < b >your text will appear in bold if you eliminate the spaces between the  < / b >  </p>
        <b>after eliminating the spaces in < > above, your text will look like this. </b>





        <h4><p><b>2) So, lets see some Basic HTML Tags</b></h4>

        HTML tags are what we use to tell a web browser how to display content in a web page.
        Most HTML tags consist of an opening and a closing tag. </p>

        So...

        <p>for bold you will use < b > and < / b > </p>
        <p>for italic you will use < em > and < / em> </p>

        The slash is used to close the command you have opened before.


<p><b>More HTML tags:</b></p>
        <p> < p >text< / p> Defines a paragraph. The content of the < p > tag is in a "box" </p>
        <p> < br > Creates a line break </p>
        <p> < div > content < /div> Creates a "box" containter element </p>
        <p> < span>content< /span> Creates an "inline" container element </p>


<b>There is a difference between Inline and Block Elements.</b>

        <b>Inline and Block are HTML Elements</b>
        <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
            elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
            them, stretching out to the left and right as far as possible.
            Block elements always start a new line while Inline elements does not. Inline elements only uses as much width as necessary.
        </p>
